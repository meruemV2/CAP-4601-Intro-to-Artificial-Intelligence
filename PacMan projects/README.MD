Explored various Artificial Intelligence techniques to solve problems that have uncertain knowledge, when
they were appropriate, and their limitations by creating and implementing various search algorithms and applying them to open-source Pacman code in Python. Using this intelligent search agent, developed understanding of informed search agents, adversarial search agents, reflex agents, and Minmax/Alpha Beta Pruning principles.
